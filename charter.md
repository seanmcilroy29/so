# Smart Objects (SO) Working Group Charter

The *Smart Objects Working Group* is responsible for the development and evolution of the Data Model used within OMASpecWorks, specifically on the Device Management WG and Application Objects. It is intended to provide an application-layer (in the OSI model) agnostic data model that can be reused across multiple verticals in the Internet of Things ecosystem.

The *Smart Objects Working Group* will provide a set of data models and schemas necessary for interoperability and will seek to work with other standard bodies to ensure interoperability. The group covers data model definitions for sensors and actuators as well as all metadata they might provide.

## Deliverables

The group is expected to provide support to the existing IPSO Smart Objects and LWM2M Objects. The group will modify those two object subsets and provide a consistent data model for both.  The group shall not be responsible for contributed third-party Objects.

The group is also expected to deliver guidelines for contribution of new Smart Objects when the existing ones are not sufficient.

The group will provide continuous validation tools for the Smart Objects and maintain them for the lifetime of the Objects.

The group will provide support for Smart Objects users via the Issue Tracker and mailing lists.

The group will look at existing standards and practices within the industry and identify opportunities for new work.

## Coordination

The WG will seek for a complete review for all its deliverables, within OMA SpecWorks and across selected specialists, specifically on topics like interoperability, application development, privacy, and security. Invitation for review must be issued before each major data model transition.

The SO Working Group will coordinate with the OMA DM Working Group when it comes to the modification of the LWM2M Objects used for management of Devices (i.e. LWM2M Objects on Device, Server, Security ...) and with the [Open Mobile LWM2M Object and Registry](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html) to provide a single registry for developers and applications.

Additional technical coordination can be sought on an ad-hoc basis with the following organisations, the list is not exhaustive and organisations can change: IETF Core Working Group, OneM2M, Open Connectivity Foundation, W3C WoT Group, Industrial Internet Consortium, Fairhair Alliance, using the appropriate SpecWorks Liaison process. 


## Participation

The group will participate in a collaborative fashion over github. Pull Requests will be the main form of contribution, in addition to comments, questions, presentations and mailing lists.

The group welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions, issue tracker comments and other feedback for consideration. With the implicit agreement from each participant to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/omadm/so/blob/master/LICENSE). (Note: The group understands that inclusion of non-members is presently at variance from current SpecWorks procedures and will seek to define and approve appropriate procedures to allow the Group to accomodate inputs from non-members.)

### Consensus Process

Changes to Objects will be reviewed by an expert review committee and by the group. Purely editorial changes might be made by appointed Editors without group consensus.

Major updates on the model, the schema or specification changes will be done within the OMA SpecWorks organisation and follow its review process. As stated in the **Coordination Section** the group will seek a complete review as part of the final consensus process.

The response period for the consensus call will be left to the chair, with no less than 7 work days for review.


### Contributor Workflow

Contributor workflow shall mirror existing SpecWorks procedures with such modifications as are necessary to ensure efficient workflow, equitable opportunity for Group member contributions and high quality Objects and documentation.

## License

The group will use the license below for all its deliverables.
<https://github.com/omadm/so/blob/master/LICENSE> (Note: the Group understands that the licenses will be reviewed by SpecWorks staff and attorney to ensure consistency with OMA licensing.  

**N.B.**: The charter might be changed or reviewed at the group's consideration.
